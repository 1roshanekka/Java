//Write a class with name volume using function overloading that computes the
//volume of cube, a sphere, a cuboid


//Method overloading is a feature of Java in which a class 
//has more than one method of the same name and their parameters are different.‚Äù
// ... When more than one method of the same name is created in a Class, this type of method is called Overloaded Methods

//constructor overloading is uselfull to initilize values and then execute area method by calling it in main method
